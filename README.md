# Task 3 – Automated Login Test for a Web Application

# Objective
The goal of this task was to create an **automated test suite** that validates the login functionality of a demo web application.  
Both **positive test cases** (valid credentials) and **negative test cases** (invalid credentials, empty fields) were included.

# Approach
1. Selected **Selenium with Python** for automation.  
2. Wrote automated scripts to:  
   - Enter valid username and password → verify successful login.  
   - Enter invalid username/password → verify error messages.  
   - Leave fields empty → verify validation prompts.  
3. Captured screenshots of test execution.  

# Test Scenarios
-  Valid login → Redirects to dashboard.  
-  Invalid login → Displays "Invalid credentials" error.  
-  Empty fields → Prompts "Username/Password required".  

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Selenium (Python)  
- WebDriver (Chrome/Firefox)  
- PyTest / Unittest Framework  

# Outcome
- Automated login tests reduced manual effort.  
- Validated authentication mechanism and error handling.  
- Ensured better reliability of login functionality.
